# To install pytest
pip install pytest

# To check the pytest version
pytest --version

# This will run the pytest
pytest

# use this to autouse the fixture before every test case
autouse=True

# -m will run all the marker test cases (use the keyword after -m to run those markers)
pytest -m sanity

# To run the all test cases which has "log" in their function
pytest -vsk Log  "c:/Users/Asad/Desktop/Selenium Projects/pytest/test_math.py"

# This will run all the test that don't have regression in their marker
pytest -m "not regression"

# This will run all the test that have regression in their marker
pytest -m "regression"

# This will give extra details of the tests
pytest -v

# To check which markers have been used in the project
pytest --markers

# To run if the marker is one of both
pytest -m "regression or sanity" -v


# Fixture scopes:
# Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their scope:

# function: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.

# class: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.

# module: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.

# package: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package.

# session: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.

simple words
autouse=True (will run the fixture automatically, you don't have to call it in every test)
function = before each (it will run before the each test)
class = before (it will run only once before the test)
session = before all the classes (it will run before all the classes)
To add finalizer
write "request.addfinalizer("Mothed name you want to call at the finalizer")


# Topics
Fixture, Module, Custom marker, Buildin Marker, -v, -m, conftest.py file, yield,

Function(function is defaul if not any scop is defined): 1. fixture and yield will be run before and after every single test.

Session scop: 1. first fixture will be run, 2.  then all the test cases, 3. then yield.


# for following better understanding there should be these files
pytest.ini = for markers information
conftest.py for the main functionality
